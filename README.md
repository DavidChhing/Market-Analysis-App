## About This Project**
Upon viewing the webpage, the visitor will see a list of instructions and images on the page. The instructions will inform the user to select the image with the product they are more likely to buy. After doing so, another 3 random images will appear, and the user will continue selecting images for 15 rounds. Once completed, the user can see their results by clicking on the "See Totals" button near the bottom of the page. The button will trigger a chart to appear with their results and which products they liked more than others.

## My Approach
- First, I made a picture array to hold the 15 pictures. Then I made a function to get 3 random picture that would appear on the screen without any duplicates. 
- Then I worked on making a function to hold the results of each click/users choice which would be displayed later in a chart.
- Next, my objective was making a for loop so that if the user selected 15 pictures and got the results, they could replay the game by selecting the image again and the counter would track their next 15 clicks.

## My References
- To make different types of tables and charts, I used the following:
  -  [JSFiddle.net] (http://jsfiddle.net/canvasjs/yzewncsh/)
  - [canvasjs.com] (https://canvasjs.com/docs/charts/basics-of-creating-html5-chart/legend/)
